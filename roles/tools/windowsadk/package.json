    "overview": "[Windows ADK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/windows-admin-center) was unveiled by Microsoft on September 14, 2017 as the necessary evolution of the Windows Server graphical user interface. Windows ADK offers a flexible, locally-deployed, browser-based management platform and tools. The idea behind this project is to help simplify the management of servers by placing a majority of the frequently referenced tools used by system administrators in one spot. You can run it on both Windows 10 and Windows Server.",
