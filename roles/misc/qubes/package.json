    "overview": "[Qubes](https://www.qubes-os.org/) is a Linux distribution that introduces some radically new concepts that basically boil down to running everything inside of a VM. It is touted by security professionals as one of (if not, the most) secure desktop operating system. In Qubes, the base namespace is called dom0 which is more or less the control point for all the other VMs that you would run applications in. This role updates dom0 and then sets up a configurable list of features into dom0 including setting up sys-usb (a VM for all your USB devices), adding YubiKey integration, forcing system updates over Tor, and a handful of other additions every Qubes user should have as part of their stack.",
