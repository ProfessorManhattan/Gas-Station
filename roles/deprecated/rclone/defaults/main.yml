user_configs: []
# For this role to work, you need to populate the user_configs variable.
# An example is provided below. It will add two mounts at /mnt/digitalocean
# and /mnt/dropbox. It will also create symbolic links that mount to the mounts
# in a newly created ~/Cloud folder. All of the rclone.name's and rclone.provider's
# should be set to unique descriptive strings.
# EXAMPLE:
# user_configs:
# - username: "{{ ansible_user | default(lookup('env', 'USER')) }}"
#   group: staff
#   rclone:
#     - name: Digital Ocean
#       provider: digitalocean
#       config: |
#         type = s3
#         env_auth = false
#         access_key_id = YourAccessKeyIDHere
#         secret_access_key = YourSecretAccessKeyHere
#         endpoint = nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com
#         acl = private
#       - name: Dropbox
#         provider: dropbox
#         config: |
#           type = dropbox
#           token = {"access_token":"YourAccessTokenHere","token_type":"bearer","expiry":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
#   - username: root
