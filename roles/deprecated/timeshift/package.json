    "overview": "[Timeshift](https://github.com/jimsalterjrs/timeshift/) is a free and open source system restore tool for Linux. Timeshift for Linux is an application that provides functionality similar to the System Restore feature in Windows and the Time Machine tool in Mac OS. Timeshift protects your system by taking incremental snapshots of the file system at regular intervals. These snapshots can be restored at a later date to undo all changes to the system.",
