# @var theme_slug_uppercase: Betelgeuse
# Name of GRUB2 theme stored in /usr/share/grub/themes. The theme gets combined with the
# `grub_theme_resolution_type` to become `Betelgeuse-1080p`, for instance. Read the description of
# `grub_theme_resolution_type` to get a better idea of how the two are combined.
theme_slug_uppercase: Betelgeuse

# @var grub_theme_resolution_type: autodetect-lowest-resolution
# Unless you manually specify this variable, the GRUB2 theme will use the lowest resolution GRUB2
# theme that matches your screen resolution (i.e. the lowest would be 1920x1080 for normal screens
# and 2440x1080 for ultrawide monitors). You can manually specify a value of `ultrawide2k`, `2k`, or
# `4k` if you know your motherboard supports it. Generally, motherboards do not support high
# resolutions unless you are using something other than a DisplayPort connector. Even then, it is
# common for motherboards to load the GRUB2 interface at low resolutions (since the GPU driver is not
# loaded yet). If you set this variable to one of the aforementioned possible values, then you might
# also want to change the value of `qubes_grub_gfxmode` to match your supported resolution. The `4k`
# is optimal at 3840x2160, the `2k` option is optimal at 2560x1440, the `1080p` option is optimal at
# 1920x1080, the `ultrawide` option is optimal at 2560x1080, and the `ultrawide2k` option is optimal
# at `3440x1440`

# @var user_configs: []
# The `user_configs` variable is an array of objects that should, at the very
# least have the `username` property defined for each user with a home directory
# that you would like this role to install the Android SDK tools into. If the
# system property is set to true, then the SDK tools will not be installed to that
# user's home directory. You can control the installation location with the `sdk_location`
# variable.

# user_configs:
#   - username: myuser
#   - username: root
#     system: true
